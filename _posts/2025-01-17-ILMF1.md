One of my new years resolutions this year is to make (at least) one zine per month. I'm inspired by my friends Heather, Anthi, and Emma (@hmarswrites, @ansklaven, and @emma.krall on instagram) who seem to all constantly be making little books/zines, and never lack copies to distribute. I wanna be like them!!

This is my January zine, celebrating five of my close friends; Misha, Fox, Quinn, Jenny, and Camilo (+ a selfie) as characters in Gaia Online. Printed at the IPRC!
