I adapted this from Bj√∂rk's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2-vfA_hs8">Sun in My Mouth</a>," off of her 2001 album, _Vespertine_. "Sun in My Mouth", is in turn based off of E.E. Cummings' poem, "<a href="https://poets.org/poem/crepuscule">Crepuscule</a>".  
  
_For my new friend:_  
  
my thighs are steeped  
in burning flowers  
sun in my mouth  
alive w/closed eyes  
the sleeping curves  
of your body  
fingers of smooth mastery  
complete  
the mystery of my flesh
