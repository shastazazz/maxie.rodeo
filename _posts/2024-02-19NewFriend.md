I adapted this from Bj√∂rk's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2-vfA_hs8">"Sun in My Mouth"</a> off of her 2001 album, Vespertine. That song itself, is based off of E.E. Cummings' poem <a href="https://poets.org/poem/crepuscule">"Crepuscule"</a>.  
  
For my new friend:  
  
my thighs are steeped  
in burning flowers  
sun in my mouth  
alive w/closed eyes  
the sleeping curves  
of your body  
fingers of smooth mastery  
complete  
the mystery of my flesh
