    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate crisis, Indigenous Sovereignty, rural-urban divide, political calcification, definition and degradation of human rights to clean air, water, life, happiness, housing, market regulation; a series of ten thousand synonyms and familiar refrains. “These are the global challenges (in local and regional settings) that must inform environmental learning… Is there a learning process that can help us better understand these dilemmas and promote constructive ways to think about them? Can we personalize these challenges while also understanding the big picture?” (Thomashow, 2020, pp. 38-39). For me, this learning process is through environmental literacy, studies, and work. The locality of Environmental Studies is critical to my own understanding, and I think is the making of personal work towards a better future. Our world is dominated economically and politically by a select fraction of the world’s population, with all the power in their hands to enforce much of the grand systemic change… I cannot personally change the course of microplastic pollution and genocidal famine conditions in Palestine, although both are incredibly prescient issues of environmental degradation and elite disinterest. And fundamentally human caused; symptoms or perhaps features of the Anthropocene: humanity’s direct, globalized impact on the biosphere. (Thomashow, 2020, pp. 39-41).

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My specific intersection of education is Environmental Studies, and Creative Writing. I’m pursuing a BS and BFA respectively, and hoping to also earn a certificate in ITECK (Indigenous Traditional Ecological and Cultural Knowledge). I am studying the human impacts and ramifications of environmental interaction, framed in Indigenous knowledge, and developing a backing sense of agency and community through the lens of creative writing; specifically poetry. This document is the first of several looking to understand what that cross-section might look like going forward.

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Perchance, when, in the course of ages, American liberty has become a fiction of the past—as it is to some extent a fiction of the present—the poets of the world will be inspired by American mythology.” (Thoreau, 2017, pp. 274-275). America has never truly had liberty. Liberty does not look like chattel slavery or the genocide of Indigenous peoples. Is the mythology of American liberty therefore worth pursuing? Thoreau leads this quote with the suggestion that “nature” and “wilderness” are only describable through the lens of mythology “You will perceive that I demand something which no Augustan nor Elizabethan age, which no culture, in short, can give. Mythology comes nearer to it than anything.” (Thoreau, 2017, pp. 274). The study and crafting of this mythology, through a personally informed, Anthropocentric lens is what I’m looking to engage with in the following documents.
