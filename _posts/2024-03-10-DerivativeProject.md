    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A derivative is a beautiful copying. It’s relying on source material as influence and inspiration. Either through unconscious osmosis, or direct intent; material is borrowed, used, changed, deliberated upon, maintained, maintenanced; stolen.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations exist: it’s a matter of who is deriving what/when/why. Derivatives are not ‘conceptualism’. Derivatives build on previous work, and do not co-opt. Think homage, ekphrasis, documentary. Derivatives are a love letter to the source, and in many cases rely on permission from and acknowledgement. Again, derivatives are not ‘conceptualism’.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether recognized or not, all writing/work/movement/expression is derivative. Derivatives are a recognition that <i>new work</i> does not exist. Derivatives study rate of change; tracking how much/fast, why, for, etc. Derivatives are often representative of cyclicity.</p>

    <h3><i>DERIVATIVES:</i></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will follow downstream (both via the tab on this website, and perhaps through future non-digital media) are earmarks and followings of thought, a series of source materials, close readings, examinations, and derivatives (and derivatives of derivatives). I am seeking to create and elaborate through derivative processes. I entertain copyright, but invite and welcome further derivatives.</p>
