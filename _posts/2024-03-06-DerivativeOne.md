            Along the western slopes of the Oregon Coastal Range . . .  
            come look: the hysterical crashing of tributaries as they 
            merge into the Wakonda Auga River . . .
    </div>
    <div class="closereadright">
        <p>Kesey’s opening line is scene setting; this one line sums up the piece.</p>
        <p><i>Come look:</i> is both an invitation and a placement; we are now inside, overlooking the <i>Wakonda Auga River</i>.</p>

        The first little washes flashing like thick rushing winds through sheep sorrel and clover, ghost fern and nettle, sheering, cutting . . . forming branches. Then, through bear- berry and salmonberry, blueberry and blackberry, the branches crashing into creeks, into streams. Finally, in the foothills, through tamarack and sugar pine, shittim bark and silver spruce—and the green and blue mosaic of Doug- las fir—the actual river falls five hundred feet . . . and look: opens out upon the fields.

        <p>Here Kesey builds out the river, forming it line by line for the reader.</p>
        <p>By using place-based vocabulary, (<i>ghost-fern</i>, <i>bearberry</i>, <i>silver spruce</i>, <i>douglas fir</i>, etc.,) Kesey denotes the PNW, and writes his fictional river into a reality that western America will recognize with familiarity, and the rest of the world can picture.</p>
        <p>Second instance of <i>look:</i>, Kesey is very specific with his placement of the reader throughout the piece, this repeated word pulls the reader out of running-lines and situates the reader’s perspective as one of close-viewer. The colon works to specify action and demands the reader to pay closer attention visually.</p>
