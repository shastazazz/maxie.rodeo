            Along the western slopes of the Oregon Coastal Range . . .  
            come look: the hysterical crashing of tributaries as they 
            merge into the Wakonda Auga River . . .
    </div>
    <div class="closereadright">
        <p>Kesey’s opening line is scene setting; a summation.</p>
        <p><i>Come look:</i> is both an invitation and a placement; we are now inside, overlooking the <i>Wakonda Auga River</i>.</p>

        The first little washes flashing like thick rushing winds through sheep sorrel and clover, ghost fern and nettle, sheering, cutting . . . forming branches. Then, through bear- berry and salmonberry, blueberry and blackberry, the branches crashing into creeks, into streams. Finally, in the foothills, through tamarack and sugar pine, shittim bark and silver spruce—and the green and blue mosaic of Doug- las fir—the actual river falls five hundred feet . . . and look: opens out upon the fields.
    </div>
    <div class="closereadright">
        <p>
            Here Kesey builds out the river, forming it line by line for the reader.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using place-based vocabulary, (<i>ghost-fern</i>, <i>bearberry</i>, <i>silver spruce</i>, <i>douglas fir</i>, etc.,) Kesey denotes the PNW, and writes his fictional river into a reality that western America will recognize with familiarity, and the rest of the world can picture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second instance of <i>look:</i>, Kesey is very specific with his placement of the reader throughout the piece, this repeated word pulls the reader out of running-lines and situates the reader’s perspective as one of close-viewer. The colon works to specify action and demands the reader to pay closer attention visually.

        Metallic at first, seen from the highway down through the trees, like an aluminum rainbow, like a slice of alloy moon. Closer, becoming organic, a vast smile of water with bro- ken and rotting pilings jagged along both gums, foam cling- ing to the lips. Closer still, it flattens into a river, flat as a street, cement-gray with a texture of rain. Flat as a rain- textured street even during flood season because of a chan- nel so deep and a bed so smooth: no shallows to set up buckwater rapids, no rocks to rile the surface . . . nothing     to indicate movement except the swirling clots of yellow foam skimming seaward with the wind, and the thrusting groves of flooded barn, bent taut and trembling by the pull of silent, dark momentum.

    <div class="closereadright">
        <p>
            There’s a corrupting here, the river is blending with “human constructs.” (<i>Slice of alloy moon</i>, <i>aluminum rainbow</i>, <i>becoming organic</i>, <i>rotting pilings</i>.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Kesey also personifies the river: <i>jagged along both gums, foam clinging to the lips</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grotesque imagery within running-lines double down on corruption of the un/natural: <i>swirling clots of yellow foam skimming seaward with the wind</i> establishes a changed landscape, a place where you won’t find groves of trees, but rather <i>groves of flooded barn</i>.

        A river smooth and seeming calm, hiding the cruel file- edge of its current beneath a smooth and calm-seeming surface.
    </div>
    <div class="closereadright">
        <p>
            This sentence serves as a refrain, pulling us back to the opening <i>hysterical crashing</i> with <i>cruel file-edge</i>, it also places the initial turbulent image of the river beneath a veneer of beauty and idyllicism, with smooth and <i>calm-seeming surface</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The river’s <i>cruel</i> reality beneath its <i>smooth and calm</i> surface establishes a place of opposing natures.
