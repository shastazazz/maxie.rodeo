This document is called _AN OUTLINE OF ERGONOMICS, Or THE SCIENCE OF WORK based upon the truths drawn from the Science of Nature_ by Wojciech Jastrzębowski, originally published in a series of journal articles in 1857, in Polish.

This is the first instance of the term "Ergonomics," which I think has become bastardized in its modern cultural understanding. Ergonomics is the study of human efficiency in working circumstances. Yes your chair might be "ergonomic," but that means it is designed in a way to increase your efficiency and productivity for your employer (or for Jastrzębowski, God).

From many hours of research, I can say with much certainty that this manuscript in full English translation was not previously available on the Internet. The download link below is the first instance of that avilability :D . (The Japanese edition was previously available, and I am linking it here for further dissemination.)

I have no rights to the work, and I have secured it through very strange means that I will not detail. Do what you will and please with the file. (I welcome any and all emails on the subject! I would love to hear what you might use it for.)

I apologize for the rough state of certain pages of the scan, I did not scan it myself. (But I cannot overstate how grateful I am to my collaborator who did!)

Expect derivatives on this subject, I plan on engaging heavily with the material in the future.

Without further ado: 1857's _AN OUTLINE OF ERGONOMICS, Or THE SCIENCE OF WORK based upon the truths drawn from the Science of Nature_, by Wojciech Jastrzębowski.
