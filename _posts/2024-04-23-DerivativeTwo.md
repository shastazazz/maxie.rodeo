I've been trying to get my hands on a full English copy of this text ever since I learned about it earlier this year. (In what must have been mid-February, or early March.)

This document is called _AN OUTLINE OF ERGONOMICS, Or THE SCIENCE OF WORK based upon the truths drawn from the Science of Nature_ by Wojciech Jastrzębowski, originally published in a series of journal articles in 1857, in Polish.

This is the first instance of the term "Ergonomics," and from what I can tell, this download right here, on this website is currently the only instance of this full English text available anywhere on the internet... Very exciting stuff. (There is a full translation available for download in Japanese, that I will link at a later date.)

I have no rights to the document, and I have secured it through very strange means that I will not detail. Do what you will and please with the file. (Perhaps email me if you do use it? I would very much like to hear your thoughts and plans!)

I apologize for the rough state of certain pages of the scan, I did not scan it myself. (But am so grateful to my collaborator who did!)

Expect derivatives on this subject, I plan on engaging heavily with the material in the future.

Without further ado: 1857's _AN OUTLINE OF ERGONOMICS, Or THE SCIENCE OF WORK based upon the truths drawn from the Science of Nature_, by Wojciech Jastrzębowski.
